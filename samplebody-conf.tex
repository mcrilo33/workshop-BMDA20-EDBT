\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, more and more data are available of many kinds, due to the large deployment of various sensors measuring different phenomenons.
Mobility data takes part of this tendency, and more specifically fleet tracking systems, which are growing rapidly and monitoring bigger and bigger fleets, aggregating trajectories of many vehicles.
In this process, various limitations are introduced, as bandwidth limitations and random corruptions or broken devices, which leads to partial corrupted data, missing data, sub-sampled data, and sometimes various sampling rates across time.\\
A fleet monitoring system works mainly with an embedded system for each monitored vehicle. This system contains a GPS module to assess vehicle's positions and instantaneous speeds across time. It also contains a GSM module to transmit registered information from the GPS module to a central database.
The main limitation is that the central database has a limited bandwidth and if it works as real time monitoring, it cannot store all information transmitted and leads to limited trajectories resolution.\\
Yet, trajectories resolution is directly linked with data quality and if we want to characterize driving behaviour, or evaluate accurate traffic evolution, we need a measure frequency rate of $1\hertz$ or more.
Thus, data imputation techniques can help to overcome this technical limitations by artificially augmenting frequency rate with inference techniques.
Moreover, it can normalizes the frequency over the whole dataset, something mandatory for many models which take fixed time series resolution.\\
Many models have been used to do data imputation for time series.
At first, simple interpolations or simple statistical inferences were used, and then k-Nearest Neighbors, ARMA based models, Markov Chain Monte Carlo models, more sophisticate statistical inference methods, or even Gaussian processes.
A broad range of method have already been used.\\
In the case of spatio-temporal series some of them can integrate spatial correlation but most of the time it is a little bit tricky to do it.
Many of them use arbitrary spatial correlation window, an assumption that is false in our case since when you follow a street the two opposite directions might have really different traffic behaviour even if they follow the same path.\\
Neural nets are more and more popular and are used for a broad kind of problems, in data imputation some papers using neural nets claim being the state of the art. Architecture and methods really depend of the data used to test the method, but it is rather clear that neural nets is a promising method to do data imputation. Moreover, many papers showed a strong connection between ResNet architecture and equation solver as euler forward method, and differential equation is a pretty natural framework to do spatio-temporal modelling.

\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

\section{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors'
names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever
possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.

The article template's documentation, available at
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
use.

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
\verb|section|, \verb|subsection|, \verb|subsubsection|, and
\verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
from the commands.


\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader. Figure captions go below the figure. Your figures should
{\bfseries also} include a description suitable for screen readers, to
assist the visually-challenged to better understand your work.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\verb|\maketitle| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}

  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
  enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
  issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
  monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
  \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
  \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
  the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
  Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
  a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
  divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
  book \cite{Knuth97}, an article in a proceedings (of a conference,
  symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article)
  \cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all possible elements
  \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated proceedings article
  \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a
  doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis:
  \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web resource
  \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1)
  \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and
  (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
  publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
  \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
  contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
  \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
  multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
  couple of citations with DOIs:
  \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online
  citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}. Artifacts:
  \cite{R} and \cite{UMassCitations}.

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. 


%%
%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}
